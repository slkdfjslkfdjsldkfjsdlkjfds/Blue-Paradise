# About
Welcome to Blue Paradise!
This is a Til Death Theme edit made specifically with 4:3 play in mind, there may be a 16:9 or 16:10 edit some other time but for now it's 4:3 exclusively.

since this *is* an edit of Til Death, your settings/config from Til Death should be compatible with Blue Paradise, you could make it Purple Paradise if you want to.

This repository is to document changes made to Blue Paradise, along as an archive of older versions for whatever reason.
As for now, it supports [version 0.74.4](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/releases/tag/v0.74.4)
